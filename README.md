# hello-world
Who am I?

I am more into finance and economics than into coding. Corporate financial modelling is my job and passion at the same time.

I look forward to create python-based environement for corporate finance modelling.

If anyone is interested in this topic, feel free to contact me.

Regards,
MJ
